# Microservices Architecture Design
## Educational Document Sharing Platform

### Executive Summary
This microservices architecture decomposes your educational document platform into five core services, each with clear boundaries and responsibilities. The design emphasizes scalability, maintainability, and separation of concerns while supporting your validation workflow requirements.

## Core Microservices

### 1. User Management Service
**Responsibility**: Handle user authentication, authorization, and profile management

**Domain Entities**:
- User profiles (students, general users)
- Trainer profiles with enhanced permissions
- Authentication tokens and sessions

**Key APIs**:
- `POST /auth/login` - User authentication
- `POST /auth/register` - User registration  
- `GET /users/{id}` - Retrieve user profile
- `PUT /users/{id}` - Update user profile
- `POST /auth/refresh` - Token refresh

**Data Storage**: PostgreSQL database for user data with Redis for session management

**External Dependencies**: Email service for notifications, external authentication providers (optional)

---

### 2. Document Management Service
**Responsibility**: Core document operations, metadata management, and file storage

**Domain Entities**:
- Document metadata and versioning
- File storage references
- Upload and download operations

**Key APIs**:
- `POST /documents` - Upload new document
- `GET /documents/{id}` - Retrieve document metadata
- `GET /documents/{id}/download` - Download file
- `PUT /documents/{id}` - Update document metadata
- `DELETE /documents/{id}` - Remove document

**Data Storage**: PostgreSQL for metadata, S3-compatible storage for files

**External Dependencies**: File storage service, virus scanning service

---

### 3. Category Management Service
**Responsibility**: Organize documents into hierarchical categories and manage taxonomies

**Domain Entities**:
- Category hierarchies
- Document-category associations
- Category permissions and access rules

**Key APIs**:
- `GET /categories` - List all categories
- `POST /categories` - Create new category
- `GET /categories/{id}/documents` - List documents in category
- `PUT /categories/{id}` - Update category details

**Data Storage**: PostgreSQL with recursive queries for hierarchical data

**External Dependencies**: Search service for category-based filtering

---

### 4. Validation Workflow Service
**Responsibility**: Manage document approval processes and validation states

**Domain Entities**:
- Validation requests and workflows
- Approval statuses and comments
- Trainer assignments for validation

**Key APIs**:
- `POST /validations` - Submit document for validation
- `GET /validations/pending` - List pending validations
- `PUT /validations/{id}/approve` - Approve document
- `PUT /validations/{id}/reject` - Reject document with comments

**Data Storage**: PostgreSQL with workflow state management

**External Dependencies**: Notification service, user management service

---

### 5. Search and Discovery Service
**Responsibility**: Provide advanced search capabilities and content recommendations

**Domain Entities**:
- Search indexes and metadata
- User search preferences
- Content recommendations

**Key APIs**:
- `GET /search?query={term}` - Full-text search
- `GET /search/advanced` - Advanced search with filters
- `GET /recommendations/{userId}` - Personalized recommendations

**Data Storage**: Elasticsearch for search indexes, Redis for caching

**External Dependencies**: Document management service, user management service

---

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### API Gateway
Centralized entry point for all client requests with responsibilities including:
- Request routing to appropriate microservices
- Authentication and authorization enforcement
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Request/response transformation
- API versioning management

### Service Communication
**Synchronous Communication**: REST APIs for real-time operations
**Asynchronous Communication**: Message queues (RabbitMQ/Apache Kafka) for:
- Document processing workflows
- Validation status updates
- User notifications
- Search index updates

### Data Consistency
**Database per Service**: Each microservice maintains its own database
**Event Sourcing**: Critical operations generate events for audit trails
**Eventual Consistency**: Accept temporary inconsistencies for better performance
**Distributed Transactions**: Use Saga pattern for complex multi-service operations

---

## Deployment Architecture

### Container Strategy
Each microservice deployed as Docker containers with:
- Independent scaling capabilities
- Health check endpoints
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Resource limit configurations

### Infrastructure Components
- **Load Balancer**: Nginx or cloud-native load balancer
- **Service Discovery**: Consul or Kubernetes native discovery
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized configuration service
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana for metrics, ELK stack for logging
- **Security**: OAuth 2.0/JWT tokens, TLS encryption, network policies

### Scalability Considerations
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Scale services independently based on demand
- **Database Sharding**: Partition large datasets across multiple database instances
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-level caching with Redis and CDN
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Background jobs for heavy operations

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
Establish core services with basic functionality:
- User Management Service with authentication
- Document Management Service with basic CRUD
- API Gateway setup and basic routing

### Phase 2: Core Features (Weeks 5-8)
- Category Management Service implementation
- Validation Workflow Service with basic approval flow
- Service-to-service communication setup

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 9-12)
- Search and Discovery Service implementation
- Advanced validation workflows
- Performance optimization and caching

### Phase 4: Production Readiness (Weeks 13-16)
- Comprehensive monitoring and logging
- Security hardening and penetration testing
- Load testing and performance tuning
- Documentation and deployment automation

## Benefits of This Architecture

**Scalability**: Each service can scale independently based on specific demands
**Maintainability**: Clear service boundaries reduce complexity and enable focused development
**Technology Flexibility**: Different services can use optimal technology stacks
**Fault Isolation**: Service failures do not cascade across the entire system
**Team Autonomy**: Different teams can own and develop services independently

This architecture provides a robust foundation for your educational document platform while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements and integrations.
